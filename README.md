# TechSupport
### PHP webapp for class representing a tech support site for a store. 

> Note: The project was developed from assignments out of Murach's PHP and MySQL 3rd Edition.
> Some of the code comes from the book's assignment prompts; however the majority of it is my own. 

This webapp utilizes an XAMPP stack: 
* PHP code runs on an Apache server.
* A multi-table SQL database runs on a MariaDB server.
* The database is accessed through the PDO API.
